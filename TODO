GENERAL:

- Styling
- Drop fields that are not supported from harvested records, warn when dropping
  unsupported contents from tags
- Multi record message support?
- List index for lists that can be long (contacts, calendar at least)
- Edit fields "Done" instead of enter for single lines at least
- Set keyboard in text record edit text field according to language?

BLUETOOTH:
- static handover support?
- full Nokia-proprietary BT2.0 support (need docs or more data)
- check BT on/off/flight mode scenarios

EVENTS:

- Sensible time display formats for events (all day, start only,
start+end on the same day, separate days)

CONTACTS:

URL:

- Should not allow many titles with same languages

MISC: (rearrange these)

* online help?
* progress indicator for BT scanning/contact fetching
* exploratory testing
* avatars for contacts, icons for BT devices?
* indications of error situations
* If contact tag name is not edited, prefill with contact name when selected?
* calendar testing with different entries
* signing?
* optimize Sp implementation, creating it all the time when editing Sp
  title to update the NDEF length may get annoying.
