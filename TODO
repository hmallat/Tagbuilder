GENERAL:

- Make UI uniform -- but which is the best way? Now some pages have
many fields while others have content item + actions.
- Move language code stuff to Util -- and try to use natural names
for languages instead of codes! 

BLUETOOTH:
- editing of BT device name, device class and bdaddr (e.g. from content
  item popup page)
- static handover support?
- full BT2.0 support (need docs or more data)

CONTACTS:

MISC (rearrange these):
* writing of tags to work
* help/about 
* BT/Contacts content item should be disabled (blinks when touched)
* Don't allow storing of BT/Contacts record if invalid device/contact info
* check BT on/off/flight mode scenarios
* progress indicator for BT scanning/contact fetching
* exploratory testing
* avatars for contacts/icons for BT devices
* indications of error situations
* Alpha-separators on contact list; fast scrolling?
* If contact tag name is not edited, prefill with contact name when selected
* contact detail selection (e.g. should not save the address without perm)
* calendar detail selection?
* calendar testing with different entries
* byte counts
* signing?
* optimize Sp implementation, creating it all the time when editing Sp
  title to update the NDEF length may get annoying.
