GENERAL:

- Refactoring of conversion/parsing code, where to translate from Qt
  identifiers to UI strings, etc...
- When harvesting a tag, undisplayed info is now dropped; should maybe
  warn the user that this happens. 

BLUETOOTH:
- full Nokia-proprietary BT2.0 support (need docs or more data)
- automatic semicolon add/del for address field?
- hex-only keyboard for editing bdaddr and cod
- Check why input limiting with regexes doesn't work as expected on N9?

MISC: (rearrange these)

* exploratory testing
* avatars for contacts, icons for BT devices?
* indications of error situations
* signing?
* optimize Sp implementation, creating it all the time when editing Sp
  title to update the NDEF length may get annoying.
