GENERAL:

- Guideline: when reading a tag, don't copy unsupported stuff over verbatim,
  just issue a warning or something if data is dropped. Check that this is
  done for all types!
- Styling (partly done)
- Drop fields that are not supported from harvested records, warn when dropping
  unsupported contents from tags
- Multi record message support?
- Set keyboard in text record edit text field according to language?
- Make sure bytes are updated always (at least when removing sp titles
  currently it doesn't work)
- Check why input limiting with regexes doesn't work on N9?
- Mini application icon for installation, too

BLUETOOTH:
- full Nokia-proprietary BT2.0 support (need docs or more data)
- check BT on/off/flight mode scenarios
- automatic semicolon add/del for address field?

EVENTS:

CONTACTS:

URL:

- Should not allow many titles with same languages

MISC: (rearrange these)

* online help?
* exploratory testing
* avatars for contacts, icons for BT devices?
* indications of error situations
* calendar testing with different entries
* signing?
* optimize Sp implementation, creating it all the time when editing Sp
  title to update the NDEF length may get annoying.
