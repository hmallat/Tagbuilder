GENERAL:

- Drop fields that are not supported from harvested records!
- Harvest tags via edit page! Don't save directly! Warn when dropping
  unsupported contents from tags

BLUETOOTH:
- static handover support?
- full BT2.0 support (need docs or more data)

EVENTS:

- Sensible time display formats for events (all day, start only,
start+end on the same day, separate days)

CONTACTS:

MISC (rearrange these):
* writing of tags to work
* help/about 
* check BT on/off/flight mode scenarios
* progress indicator for BT scanning/contact fetching
* exploratory testing
* avatars for contacts, icons for BT devices?
* indications of error situations
* Alpha-separators on contact list; fast scrolling?
* If contact tag name is not edited, prefill with contact name when selected
* calendar testing with different entries
* signing?
* optimize Sp implementation, creating it all the time when editing Sp
  title to update the NDEF length may get annoying.
